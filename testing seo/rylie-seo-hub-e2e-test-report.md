# Rylie SEO Hub E2E Test Report

**Date**: June 26, 2025  
**Test Environment**: https://rylie-seo-hub.onrender.com  
**Tester**: AI Testing Agent

## Executive Summary

Initial automated testing has been performed on the Rylie SEO Hub platform. The site is accessible and responding with proper HTTP status codes. However, manual testing is required to complete the full E2E test suite as OAuth authentication and UI interactions cannot be automated without proper credentials.

- [ ] Click "Sign in with Google" button
- [ ] Complete OAuth authentication flow
- [ ] Verify redirect to dashboard after successful login
- [ ] Check for agency setup prompt (first-time users)

#### 2. Chat Interface Testing
- [ ] Navigate to `/chat` after authentication
- [ ] Send test message: "What are the best SEO strategies for car dealerships?"
- [ ] Verify AI response appears within reasonable time (<5 seconds)

#### 4. Webhook Integration Testing

After creating an order, note the Order ID and test webhooks:

**Step 1: Update to In Progress**
```bash
# Replace [ORDER-ID] with actual order ID from step 3
curl -X POST https://rylie-seo-hub.onrender.com/api/seoworks/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-seoworks-signature: sha256=test-signature" \
  -d '{
    "eventType": "task.updated",
    "taskId": "test-seoworks-123",
    "orderId": "[ORDER-ID]",
    "status": "in_progress",
    "assignedTo": "test@seoworks.com"
  }'
```

- [ ] Verify order status updates to "in_progress"

**Step 2: Mark as Completed**
```bash
curl -X POST https://rylie-seo-hub.onrender.com/api/seoworks/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-seoworks-signature: sha256=test-signature" \
  -d '{
    "eventType": "task.completed",
    "taskId": "test-seoworks-123",
    "orderId": "[ORDER-ID]",
    "status": "completed",
    "completedAt": "2025-06-26T15:00:00Z",
    "deliverables": {
      "post_title": "Essential Summer Car Maintenance Tips",
      "post_url": "https://example-dealer.com/blog/summer-maintenance",
      "word_count": 523
    },
    "completionNotes": "Blog post completed and published"
  }'
```

- [ ] Verify order shows as "completed" with deliverables

#### 5. User Management (Admin Testing)
- [ ] Navigate to `/admin/users` (requires admin role)
- [ ] Test "Invite User" functionality
- [ ] Enter email: testinvite@example.com
- [ ] Select role: "user"
- [ ] Send invitation and verify success
- [ ] Check if email notification is sent (if SMTP configured)

#### 6. Theme Customization
- [ ] Navigate to `/theme`
- [ ] Test color picker for primary color
- [ ] Update company name to "Test Dealership"
- [ ] Upload test logo (if available)
- [ ] Save changes
- [ ] Verify theme updates across all pages

#### 7. Error Handling Tests

- [ ] Submit order with missing required fields (should show validation errors)
- [ ] Send webhook with invalid signature (should return error)
- [ ] Navigate to non-existent page (should show 404 page)

#### 8. Mobile Responsiveness

- [ ] Check for any broken links

## Identified Issues

### üî¥ Critical Issues
1. **Missing Health Check Endpoint**: `/api/health` returns 404 instead of expected health status
   - **Impact**: Monitoring and uptime checks may fail
   - **Recommendation**: Implement basic health check endpoint

### üü° Medium Priority Issues
1. **API Documentation**: No public API documentation available
   - **Impact**: Difficult to test API endpoints thoroughly
   - **Recommendation**: Add API documentation or OpenAPI spec

## Recommendations

1. **Implement Health Check**: Add `/api/health` endpoint for monitoring
2. **Add Test Accounts**: Create dedicated test accounts for E2E testing
3. **API Documentation**: Document all API endpoints and expected responses
4. **Error Logging**: Ensure proper error logging for debugging
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Implement performance tracking for critical user flows

## Next Steps

1. Manual testing team should complete the checklist above
2. Document any additional issues found during manual testing
3. Prioritize fixes based on severity and user impact
4. Re-test after fixes are implemented

## Test Coverage Summary

- **Automated Tests Completed**: 20%
- **Manual Tests Required**: 80%
- **Critical Paths Covered**: Pending manual testing
- **API Coverage**: Limited due to authentication requirements
