# Real Root Cause Analysis

## Actual Error Found

```
Error creating invite: Error [PrismaClientKnownRequestError]: 
Invalid `prisma.userInvite.create()` invocation:

Foreign key constraint violated on the constraint: `user_invites_invitedBy_fkey`
```

## Root Cause
The `/api/users/invite` endpoint is failing because:

1. **Foreign Key Constraint Violation**: The `invitedBy` field in the `userInvite.create()` call references a user ID that doesn't exist in the database
2. **Authentication Issue**: The current user session likely contains a user ID that hasn't been properly created in the database
3. **Database State Problem**: There's a mismatch between the session user and the actual users in the database

## Code Location
- File: `/api/users/invite/route.ts`
- Line: Around line 111 in the compiled code
- Function: `prisma.userInvite.create()`

## Investigation Needed
1. Check what user ID is being passed as `invitedBy`
2. Verify if that user actually exists in the database
3. Check the authentication flow and user creation process
4. Examine the database schema and constraints

This is NOT a configuration issue - it's a real database constraint violation.
