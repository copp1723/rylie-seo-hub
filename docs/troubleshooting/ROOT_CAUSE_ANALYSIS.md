# ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED - Authentication Issue

## âœ… **Real Problem Found**

### **Issue**
Users are not being created in the database during Google OAuth sign-in, causing the invite API to fail with foreign key constraint violations.

### **Root Cause**
1. **Invalid OAuth Credentials**: Google OAuth credentials are set to placeholder values:
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="placeholder-google-client-id"`
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="placeholder-google-client-secret"`

2. **Incomplete Authentication Flow**: 
   - NextAuth creates temporary sessions but can't complete OAuth with Google
   - No user records are created in the database (0 users, 0 accounts, 0 sessions)
   - Session exists in memory/cookies but user doesn't exist in database

3. **Foreign Key Constraint Violation**:
   - Invite API tries to use `currentUser.id` as `invitedBy`
   - This ID doesn't exist in the database because user was never created
   - Results in P2003 Prisma error

### **Evidence**
- Database test shows 0 users, 0 accounts, 0 sessions
- Manual user creation works perfectly
- Database connectivity is fine
- NextAuth configuration is correct except for OAuth credentials

### **Impact**
- Users can "sign in" but aren't actually authenticated
- All invite functionality fails with 500 errors
- Session appears valid but database is empty

## **Solution Required**
Need to either:
1. Fix OAuth credentials in production environment
2. Add fallback user creation mechanism
3. Improve error handling for invalid authentication states
