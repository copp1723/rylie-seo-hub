# Chat Route Auth Bypass Fix Report

**Date**: June 25, 2025  
**Branch**: fix/chat-auth-bypass  
**Ticket**: FIX-chat-auth-bypass

## Summary

Successfully removed auth bypass and hardcoded agency IDs from chat and conversation routes.

## Changes Made

### 1. Conversations Route (`src/app/api/conversations/route.ts`)

#### Before:
- Used hardcoded `userId: 'test-user-id'`
- Used hardcoded `agencyId: 'default'`
- Auth was disabled with commented imports

#### After:
- Uses `withAuth()` wrapper for proper authentication
- Uses `getTenantDB()` for tenant-aware database operations
- Extracts `agencyId` from authenticated session context
- Enforces conversation limits based on agency plan

### 2. Chat Route (`src/app/api/chat/route.ts`)

#### Before:
- Used mock user object with hardcoded values
- Used hardcoded `agencyId: 'default-agency'`
- Auth imports were commented out
- Manual tenant context creation

#### After:
- Uses `withAuth()` wrapper for proper authentication
- Uses authenticated context for user and tenant information
- All references to hardcoded `user` object replaced with `context.user`
- Proper tenant isolation maintained throughout

## Technical Details

### Authentication Pattern Applied:
```typescript
export const GET = withAuth(async (request, context) => {
  // context.user - authenticated user
  // context.tenant - tenant context with agencyId
  const db = getTenantDB(context)
  // All database operations are now tenant-scoped
})
```

### Key Improvements:
1. **Security**: No more auth bypass - all routes require authentication
2. **Multi-tenancy**: Proper agency isolation enforced
3. **Consistency**: Both routes use the same authentication pattern
4. **Audit Trail**: All operations tracked with proper user/agency context

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Authentication Tests**:
   - Verify unauthenticated requests return 401
   - Verify cross-tenant access returns 403

2. **Conversation Tests**:
   - Create conversation with authenticated user
   - Verify conversation is scoped to user's agency
   - Test conversation limits enforcement

3. **Chat Tests**:
   - Send chat message with authenticated user
   - Verify messages are saved with correct agencyId
   - Test super admin bypass for limits

## Files Modified

1. `src/app/api/conversations/route.ts`
   - Removed auth bypass
   - Added proper authentication wrapper
   - Fixed hardcoded agency ID

2. `src/app/api/chat/route.ts`
   - Removed mock user object
   - Fixed all hardcoded references
   - Proper context usage throughout

## Next Steps

1. Run tests to verify authentication works correctly
2. Test multi-tenant isolation
3. Deploy to staging for integration testing
4. Monitor for any authentication errors
