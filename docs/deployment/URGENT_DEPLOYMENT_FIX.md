# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Fix Your Deployment NOW

Your deployment is failing because the API routes are checking for authentication, but auth is disabled in the middleware. Here's the immediate fix:

## Step 1: Add Environment Variables in Render

Go to your Render dashboard â†’ Environment â†’ Add these variables:

```
AUTH_DISABLED=true
DEFAULT_USER_ID=test-user-id
DEFAULT_USER_EMAIL=user@example.com
DEFAULT_AGENCY_ID=default-agency
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=<your-actual-openrouter-key>
```

## Step 2: Restart Your Service

After adding the environment variables, either:
- Click "Manual Deploy" â†’ "Deploy latest commit"
- OR click on your service â†’ "Restart service"

## What This Does

- `AUTH_DISABLED=true` tells the API to skip authentication checks
- The DEFAULT_* variables provide fallback user information
- This makes every request act as if it's from a logged-in admin user

## Step 3: Verify It Works

Once deployed:
1. Go to https://rylie-seo-hub.onrender.com
2. You should auto-redirect to /dashboard
3. All sidebar links should work
4. Chat, orders, and other features will function

## Local Testing First (Optional)

Run these commands locally to test:

```bash
# In your project directory
cd /Users/copp1723/Desktop/rylie-seo-hub-main

# Set up the database with default data
npm run db:generate
npm run db:push
npx tsx scripts/setup-default-data.ts

# Test locally with auth disabled
AUTH_DISABLED=true npm run dev
```

## Next Steps After It Works

Once your app is working:

1. **Implement SEO Works Integration**
   - Add webhook endpoints for SEO Works
   - Create API for order routing
   - Implement the "walled garden" separation

2. **Fix Authentication Properly**
   - Set up proper email configuration
   - Test magic link authentication
   - Remove AUTH_DISABLED flag

3. **Add Multi-tenancy Features**
   - Agency isolation
   - Dealership onboarding
   - GA4 integration

## Why This Happened

The codebase has two auth systems:
1. Middleware (disabled) - doesn't block requests
2. API route handlers (enabled) - returns 401 errors

The environment variable `AUTH_DISABLED=true` tells BOTH systems to skip auth checks.
